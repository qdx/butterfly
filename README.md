## Butterfly effect
Inspired by the concept of butterfly effect, specifically the concept that one small action in the past could drastically change
the future. I want to make a game based on that concept, where player can see what they their action will result in the
future. It's very primal prototype and anything could change.

Please feel free to drop a comment, they will be highly appreciated!
